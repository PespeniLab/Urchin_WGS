# The geneList data is based on a differential expression analysis 
# of the ALL(Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) dataset that was 
# extensively studied in the literature on microarray analysis 
# Chiaretti, S., et al. (2004). Our toy example contains just a 
# small amount, 323, of genes and their corresponding p-values.

# The next data one needs are the gene groups itself, the GO terms 
# in our case, and the mapping that associate each gene with one or 
# more GO term(s). The information on where to find the GO annotations 
# is stored in the ALL object and it is easily accessible.
